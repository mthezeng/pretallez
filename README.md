# Pret Allez

Prêt? Allez! is French for "Ready? Go!" – it is what international fencing referees say to start a bout (after, of course, "En gardé!").

There are three types of fencing: epeé, foil, and sabre. In foil and sabre, when two fencers touch each other at the same time,
the referee must decide which fencer to award the touch to by following the rules of "right-of-way". For newcomers, these rules
can be complicated, but the way I like to describe it is that it is essentially "taking turns". Whoever starts the attack first
gets the right-of-way first, but if they miss, get parried, or stop their attack, then their turn ends, and it becomes the
opponent's turn to hit. If two fencers touch at the same time, it is the referee's job to determine who's turn it was to hit
and award a touch to that person.

On index.html, you will find a tool which will allow you to construct a fencing referee's call based on the rules of
right-of-way. The implementation for this feature is very rough right now because I am just starting to learn how to use
JavaScript and HTML. However, in the future, I envision this feature could be applied to videos of fencing actions. Users would
be able to input what they would call if they were refereeing, and Pret Allez would compare their input against what the
referee in the video actually called. In this way, we could develop a fun and unique way of training fencing referees!
