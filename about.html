          <h1>About</h1>

          <p style="margin-top:20px;"><i>Prêt? Allez!</i> is French for "Ready? Go!" – it is what
          international fencing referees say to start a bout (after, of course,
          "En gardé!").</p>
          <p>There are three types of fencing: epeé, foil, and sabre. In foil and
          sabre, when two fencers touch each other at the same time, the referee must
          decide which fencer to award the touch to by following the rules of "right-of-way".
          For newcomers, these rules can be complicated, but the way I like to describe
          it is that it is essentially "taking turns". Whoever starts the attack first
          gets the right-of-way first, but if they miss, get parried, or stop their attack,
          then their turn ends, and it becomes the opponent's turn to hit. If two fencers
          touch at the same time, it is the referee's job to determine who's turn it
          was to hit and award a touch to that person.</p>
          <p>On the <a href="./index.html">main page</a>, you will find a tool which
          will allow you to construct a fencing referee's call based on the rules of
          right-of-way. In the future, I envision this feature could be applied to videos of fencing actions.
          Users would be able to input what they would call if they were refereeing,
          and Pret Allez would compare their input against what the referee in the
          video actually called. In this way, we could develop a fun and unique way
          of training fencing referees!</p>
